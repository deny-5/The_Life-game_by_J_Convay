# The_Life-game_by_J_Convay
This is cell automat game created by John Convey in 1970.
It's intresting for me cose this game is  beautiful small
pece of math, which is one of my favorite subject.
And it cool twice becose this repo is my first.

This game goes on cell-grid field and it goes automaticly.
Player can only set the first positions of "living" cells.
Then the game get started, computer calculate and show new
generations of living cells, based on which cells were choosen
by player, and all the next generations based on the previos one.
To calculate new positions of living cells algorithm use the
next one rules:
  1) if a living cell has 2 or 3 living neighbours, it stay
     alive in the next generation;
  2) if quantity of living has more then 3 or less then 2
     living neighbours, it dies;
` 3) empty cell that has 3 living cells near it will comes
     alive in the next game cicle.
